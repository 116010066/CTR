# CTR
Predicting Click-through Rates on Display Ads by Deep Learning Project

Constructed Neural Network models and traditional ML models to make CTR prediction

• Utilized GBDT to transform data for subsequent one-hot encoding and combined with Factorization Machine to make classifications in Python as baseline model with an accuracy of 75%
• Adopted PCA and UMAP for data preprocessing and analyzed model performance with ROC and AUC
• Implemented MLP models in Tensorflow that classify whether ads will be clicked on one million ads datasets with accuracy of 78%
